schedge
=======

A timeline tool that strives for the unique utility of aligning with subjective experiences of time. The primary goal is to support the following axioms with minimal compromise:

* keeping shorter timeframes (such as the previous / next hour) in view is of utmost **urgency**
* keeping longer timeframes (such as one's expected lifetime, or the [previous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene) / [next](http://longnow.org/) 10 ka) in perspective is of utmost **importance**

Schedge can be thought of, more pertinently, as my collated experiments with representations of time data. Or as whatever foolish thing my best ever idea for a project in June 2013 happened to be.

## Inspiration
- [Logarithmic calendar](http://abstractfactory.blogspot.com/2011/01/logarithmic-calendar-i-want.html). I believe even the separation into days perhaps "overdoes the metaphor", to use the phrase of Marco Arment, who is the first one I am aware of to [express this idea](http://www.marco.org/2010/03/28/more-ideas-than-time-logarithmic-calendar-view).
